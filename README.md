## Customizations
If you want to customize the look and feel to your preference, then navigate to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/nepali-date@biplab/` and add a `css` file. You can also edit `extension.js` file if you know what you are doing because it might break the extension if improperly configured.
